# Event Attendance Tracker — Frontend

The frontend is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [React](https://react.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query), [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) for package management

## Quick Start

From the project root, install the dependencies and start the frontend development server:

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

Then open <http://localhost:5173/> in your browser.

Run `uv run bash scripts/prestart.sh` and `uv run fastapi dev` from the `backend` directory, with PostgreSQL running in Docker Compose. See [development.md](../development.md) for the complete setup.

To serve the frontend with FastAPI, run `bun run build` from the `frontend` directory and open `http://localhost:8000`.

Check `frontend/package.json` to see the other available commands.

## Generate Client

### Automatically

* From the project root, run the script:

```bash
bash ./scripts/generate-client.sh
```

* Commit the changes.

### Manually

* Make sure the backend is running.

* Download the OpenAPI JSON file from `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/openapi.json` and copy it to a new file `openapi.json` at the root of the `frontend` directory.

* To generate the frontend client, run:

```bash
bun run generate-client
```

* Commit the changes.

Regenerate the client whenever backend changes affect the OpenAPI schema.

## Code Structure

The frontend code is structured as follows:

* `frontend/src` - The main frontend code.
* `frontend/public` - Static assets.
* `frontend/src/client` - The generated OpenAPI client.
* `frontend/src/components` - The components of the frontend, including the shadcn/ui components in `frontend/src/components/ui`.
* `frontend/src/hooks` - Custom hooks.
* `frontend/src/lib` - Shared frontend utilities.
* `frontend/src/routes` - The frontend routes and pages.

## End-to-End Testing with Playwright

The frontend includes end-to-end tests using Playwright. To run the tests, you need to have the Docker Compose stack running. Start the stack with the following command:

```bash
docker compose run --rm backend bash scripts/prestart.sh
docker compose up -d --wait backend
```

Then, you can run the tests with the following command:

```bash
bunx playwright test
```

You can also run your tests in UI mode to see the browser and interact with it running:

```bash
bunx playwright test --ui
```

To stop and remove the Docker Compose stack and clean the data created in tests, use:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

To update the tests, navigate to the tests directory and modify the existing test files or add new ones as needed.

For more information on writing and running Playwright tests, refer to the official [Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro).
